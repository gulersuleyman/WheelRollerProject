Wheel Roller Prototype, joined effort with @Scientist8

There is a bug list at the end of this document!


In this runner type prototype, the player controls a person rolling a wheel and moving forward to a beautiful sunset.

Picking up planets which are earth, saturn and mars, will make the wheel bigger.

Going on red carpets will make the wheel smaller.

Obstacles will cause you to fall from the wheel.

If you can make it, there is a bonus slot machine at the end, giving 10x, 20x and 100x according to your luck.

The debug menu console is on the upper left corner of the game.

The menu consists of camera settings, movement speed settings and the obstacle number that will be spawn.

Hope you enjoy!



As one may notice and also like many other developers we had encountered many bugs. We could address and solve the majority
of these bugs, however there are some left, leaving our hearts a little broken.

Here is the list the bugs we've encountered and couldn't address in this version of the game;


1- In debug menu you can change various parameters of the game, however if you try and change three times, movement speed
and obstacle number parameters are not changing, they are losing their reference. However if you close and start the game again
it will work normally, until three times again.
2- Sometimes on the first go, "Retry" panel seems to get behind the "Game" panel. After your first fail when try to click on the
retry button, it doesn't work. In order to solve this, first click on the Settings button that is on the upper left corner. After
this step it works normally.
